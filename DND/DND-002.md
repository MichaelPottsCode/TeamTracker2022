Selected images are now saved and retrieved from the local documents storage. Moved the saving of images to the Save Profile functionality in the form view. However, when the images are displayed as part of the Player List Item,  they are considerably smaller than the background shape.

Resolved the issue by removing the .scaledToFit modifier on the player image view.

Need to think about a layout for the form view that allows the user to change an existing image, as well as pick an image for a new player.
