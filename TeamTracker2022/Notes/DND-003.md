##  Design Diary Notes 003

**8:45 am**
Today's goal: rework the player form to handle both a new player and the update of an existing player. Need to review the methodology presented by Stewart Lynch.

Added a generic player image placeholder.

**12:04 pm**
Player form has been reworked to handle the new player using the modal type approach from SL.

Need to look at the update player section yet and determine how and where to implement the Edit player button. Options include;
* Swipe to Edit on a player
* Adding an overlay with a *Edit* button on the player list item view

**1:02 pm**
Updated the placeholder player image to have a gray background.

**7:38 pm**
Why doesn't the view refresh after an update (either String values or the player image)to the player. Need to finish watching the videos from SL to see if any clues are provided.
